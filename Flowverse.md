Now that you've learned how to program in Cadence and write upgradeable smart contracts, you may be asking yourself:

Now what?


## Enter into the Flowverse

Once you make a project on Flow, you can show it off on [Flowverse](https://www.flowverse.co/).

Think of the Flowverse like a central hub where Flow projects are shown to the public. Everything from individual NFT projects to the overall Flow projects *[rankings](https://www.flowverse.co/rankings)* are put on display for a wider web3 audience to see.

Thus, by using flowverse you  can potentially get more eyes on your project.

## Getting your project onto the flowverse

If you want your project to be displayed on the flowverse website, you must fill this [application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd7Yfw5_ugvPKijL1AGjadIUibQuy0TCdlzawcLW2lZPO6G1g/viewform).

## Building on the main network

If you are interested getting your project on Flowverse, LearnWeb3 will be helping students to receive *Flow grants* which will give you the funds to build on the main network.

## Flowverse Resources


Other than getting your work on Flowverse, there are also other services available through Flow:

- [Flow community](https://discord.com/invite/flowverse)
- [Flow Job Board](https://jobs.flowverse.co/)
- [Flow Investor Support](https://www.flowverse.co/investors)
- [Flow Airdrops & Whitelists](https://www.flowverse.co/airdrops)

You can also search for indivdual projects using a *search* feature. So when your project is added to the flowverse, you can easily find it.
